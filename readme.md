# webgl-102

Notes taken while I learn WebGL.

## Branches

I split my learnings / experiments into different branches.

- `master` - a template for other branches. contains common code needed to render something.
- [`notes`](https://github.com/armno/webgl-102/tree/notes) - random notes taken while i learn differnt things
- [`3d-model`](https://github.com/armno/webgl-102/tree/3d-model) - drawing a rotating car from a free 3D model.
- [`threejs`](https://github.com/armno/webgl-102/tree/threejs) - creating a rotating cube (again!) but with [Three.js](https://threejs.org).
